            <p>I consider myself a kind and generous person. I like to think I treat everybody in a respectful manner and I pay close attention to what I can learn from them. I'm also an ambitious person who loves great challenges, thus are the ones that bring most growth. But what I love most are the opportunities to work in a team of motivated people from who I can learn and with whom I can grow professionally and personally.</p>
            <p>I was born in Mallorca, and have lived here eversince. As I'm completing most of my studies, at the moment I'm living with my mother and younger brother in a flat near the sea.</p>
            <p>I have also dedicated a part of my life volunteering in the scouts. Firstly as a lesiure time monitor, organizing trips for children in which they learned everydy lessons such as the value of recicling, gender equality and taking care of nature. Lately, I took place as Secretary of the organization.</p>

            <p>Two years ago I discovered the benefits of sport. I started practising fitness routines, and after three months I discovered a fantastic mobile App: Freelethics Bodyweight; so I switched to bodyweight training.</p>
            <p>That is that you train only with the resistance of your own weight. This exercises demand much more patience and self-control, so it helps me deal with the stress of everyday's life, full of rush and nerves. I always try to make some time in the morning to practise calisthenia, so I feel calm and in peace the rest of the day.</p>
            <p>But sports do not only make you feel better, and stronger. They also mean a way of connecting with people with shared interests and becoming a part of the community. Sport is a great way to learn that changing takes time and becoming better takes practise.</p>
            <p>Here I'd like to share a video so you can see what I do. What it means to be a free athlete.</p>
