Pere Pico

My name is Pere, I'm 22 years old and I'm a software developer and free athlete.

## Who am I
I consider myself a kind and generous person. I like to think I treat everybody in a respectful manner and I pay close attention to what I can learn from them. I'm also an ambitious person who loves great challenges, thus are the ones that bring most growth. But what I love most are the opportunities to work in a team of motivated people from who I can learn and with whom I can grow professionally and personally.

I was born in Mallorca, and have lived here eversince. As I'm completing most of my studies, at the moment I'm living with my mother and younger brother in a flat near the sea.

I have also dedicated a part of my life volunteering in the scouts. Firstly as a lesiure time monitor, organizing trips for children in which they learned everydy lessons such as the value of recicling, gender equality and taking care of nature. Lately, I took place as Secretary of the organization.

## Studies

My first attempt was videogame development at the EDIB, but then I discovered that I loved computer science, programming and designing software.

My regulated studies consist of:
- Grado de Ingeniería Informática by the Open University of Catalunya
- Master Full Stack Web Developer by the KeepCoding academy.

I have also taken many online courses from online platforms such as Udemy as plural as:
- Accounting economincs
- JAVA programming
- Fotography 101

## Experiences

At the moment I'm still looking for an opportunity that suits my desires of contributing to a great project to grow as a software developer.

But in the meantime, I teach Object Oriented Programming to undergrad students as a tutor.

## About me

mens sana in corpore sano

Two years ago I discovered the benefits of sport. I started practising fitness routines, and after three months I discovered a fantastic mobile App: Freelethics Bodyweight; so I switched to bodyweight training.

That is that you train only with the resistance of your own weight. This exercises demand much more patience and self-control, so it helps me deal with the stress of everyday's life, full of rush and nerves. I always try to make some time in the morning to practise calisthenia, so I feel calm and in peace the rest of the day.

But sports do not only make you feel better, and stronger. They also mean a way of connecting with people with shared interests and becoming a part of the community. Sport is a great way to learn that changing takes time and becoming better takes practise.

Here I'd like to share a video so you can see what I do. What it means to be a free athlete.
